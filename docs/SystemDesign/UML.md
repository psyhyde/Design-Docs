# UML: Unified Modeling Language



- Defintion:

  UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standard language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems. UML was created by the Object Management Group (OMG) and UML 1.0 specification draft was proposed to the OMG in January 1997. It was initially started to capture the behavior of complex software and non-software system and now it has become an OMG standard. This tutorial gives a complete understanding on UML.

- Audience:

  This tutorial has been prepared for beginners to help them understand the fundamentals of UML. After completing this tutorial you will find yourself at a moderate level of expertise from where you can take yourself to the next levels.

- Prerequisites 

  No specific skill is required as a prerequisite to understand the learning material in this tutorial. The reader must be enthusiastic to acquire knowledge on UML.

## Overview
?>[Overview 👈🏻](/SystemDesign/UML/UMLOverview.md)
- UML stands for **Unified Modeling Language**.
- UML is different from the other common programming languages such as C++, Java, COBOL, etc.
- UML is a pictorial language used to make software blueprints.
- UML can be described as a general purpose visual modeling language to visualize, specify, construct, and document software system.
- Although UML is generally used to model software systems, it is not limited within this boundary. It is also used to model non-software systems as well. For example, the process flow in a manufacturing unit, etc.

UML is not a programming language but tools can be used to generate code in various languages using UML diagrams. UML has a direct relation with object oriented analysis and design. After some standardization, UML has become an OMG standard.
